    <h1>EcoElectronix's Mission</h1>
    <h2 class="line">
			<p>
      Our mission is simple. Produce top quality electronic products using sustainable materials
			and manufacturing practices. Many of todays electronic manufacturers produce
			products containing materials that are harmful to our planet. Supporting companies and individuals that are practicing sustainable manufacturing
			is very importnat to us.
			<p>
		  This is why we donate to environmental charities. For every sale made, we make a donation to environmental
			charities including Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Alliance, and Earthjustice.
			We realize there's a bigger battle being fought to keep our planet clean and green. By donating to these
			charities our company and our customers are supporting those on the front lines, fighting to keep the World a safe place to live.
